    <p>Sushi is a great Japanese dish to try. Although simple in ingredients, it is hard to roll right but can be done with patience.</p>
    <p>That being said it can be cheaper to make at home than it is to go out and order sushi. You can also make it with the you prefer and with sauces you enjoy more!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 sheets sushi seaweed</li>
        <li>1 batch prepared sushi rice</li>

        <li>1 avocado sliced</li>
        <li>soy sauce for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
